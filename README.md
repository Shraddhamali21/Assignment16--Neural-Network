1. GAS TURBINE DATASET

In this data science project, I addressed the task of predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features. Leveraging the capabilities of Neural Networks, specifically deep learning models, I aimed to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts the energy output of a gas turbine based on ambient environmental conditions. The dataset used for this analysis is named "gas_turbines.csv," containing sensor measurements and ambient variables recorded from a gas turbine, along with the corresponding turbine energy yield. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the turbine energy yield (TEY) based on ambient variables such as ambient temperature, pressure, humidity, and various sensor measurements from the gas turbine. By leveraging Neural Network models, the goal is to capture complex nonlinear relationships between the ambient variables and turbine energy yield, enabling accurate predictions of energy output.
 
Approach:
 
The project follows a structured approach to model development and analysis, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the ambient variables and turbine energy yield.
 - Preprocessing the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
 
2. Model Training using Neural Networks:
 - Implementing Neural Network models, specifically deep learning models, to build a regression model for predicting turbine energy yield.
 - Configuring the architecture of the Neural Network, including the number of layers, activation functions, and optimizer settings.
 
3. Model Evaluation and Tuning:
 - Evaluating the performance of the Neural Network model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.
 - Tuning hyperparameters of the Neural Network model through techniques like GridSearchCV or manual adjustment to optimize performance.
 
4. Insights and Recommendations:
 - Deriving actionable insights from the trained Neural Network model to understand the key factors influencing turbine energy yield.
 - Providing recommendations for optimizing turbine operation and maximizing energy output based on the model's predictions and insights.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Keras, the project aims to provide a reliable and accurate predictive model for forecasting turbine energy yield.
